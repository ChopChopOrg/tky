  dogs: {
    get: {
      searchParams: { limit: number };
      result: Dog[];
    };
    post: {
      json: Dog;
      result: { id: number };
    };
  };
}>({ prefixUrl: "https://example.com/dogs" });

const breeds = await dogsApi
  .get("dogs", {}, { searchParams: { limit: 20 } })
  .json()
  .then((json) => json.map((dog) => dog.breed));
```

## Alternatives

**But what if I don't trust my backend?**

In this scenario, you should definitely not use tky!
Decode the data you receive. Few recommendations:

### API clients

- [fetcher-ts](https://github.com/YBogomolov/fetcher-ts)

### Decoding

- [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts)
- [ts.data.json](https://github.com/joanllenas/ts.data.json)
- [runtypes](https://github.com/pelotom/runtypes)

## Examples

You can find examples in [./example.ts](./example.ts) and [tests](./src/index.test.ts).

## API

### tky

`tky` constructor receives `EndpointsSpec` in generic parameter.
It is used for inference of endpoint names, arguments and return types.

#### example

```ts
const dogsApi = tky<{
  dogs: {
    get: {
      searchParams: {
        limit: number;
      };
      result: Dog[];
    };
    post: {
      json: Dog;
      result: {
        id: number;
      };
    };
  };
}>({ prefixUrl: "https://example.com/dogs" });
```

#### signature

```ts
const tky = <T extends EndpointsSpec>(
  defaultOptions: ky.Options,
  create: (options: ky.Options) => KyInstance = ky.create
): TypedKyInstance<T>
```

### TypedKyInstance

#### methods

The value returned from `tky` has methods for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` HTTP methods with following signature.

```ts
type Method = (
  endpoint: string,
  endpointParams?: Record<string, string | number>,
  options?: ky.Options
) => ResponsePromise;
```

Methods which are not defined in `EndpointsSpec` generic parameter are
hidden on type level.

#### kyInstance

We include the reference of _ky_ instance the client was created with.

```ts
interface TypedKyInstance {
  kyInstance: typeof ky;
}
```
